INSTALLING

Compile using javac, either to a set of *.class files or a *.jar file.


RUNNING

The program must be run on the command line. It can be called in one of two ways:
    java (Main or jar file) <input-filename>
    java (Main or jar file) <input-filename> <config-filename>

Where:
    input-filename is the path, relative or absolute, to the file containing input.
    config-filename is the path, relative or absolute, to the penalty value configuration file.

If config-filename is not specified, the application will look for "config.properties" in the
running directory. If this is not found, it will instead initialize all penalties and weights
to 0.

When done, the program will output the solution to stdout, and will also write to a file
with the name <department>-schedule.txt, where department is the name of the department as
provided in the input file.


CONFIG

config.properties is included with the project. It is reproduced below:
     # This config file is used to set up penalty values for the search program.
     #   penCourseMin = penalty for courses (lectures) not fulfilling minimum values
     #   penLabsMin = penalty for labs (tutorials) not fulfilling minimum values
     #   penNotPaired = penalty for paired courses not being scheduled together
     #   penSection = penalty for multiple sections of the same course scheduled together
     #   wMinFilled = weight applied to penCourseMin/penLabsMin
     #   wPref = weight applied to preferences penalty
     #   wPair = weight applied to penNotPaired
     #   wSecDiff = weight applied to penSection
    penCourseMin=100
    penLabsMin=100
    penNotPaired=0
    penSection=10
    wMinFilled=1
    wPref=0
    wPair=0
    wSecDiff=0

To alter penalty values, simply change the numerical values after the '=' for the respective
properties.
